# How to Boil an Egg

**Ingredients:**  
- Eggs
- Oil   
- Ice (for cooling)  

**Instructions:**  

1. **Prepare the pot:**  
   - Place eggs in a single layer in a microwave.  
   - Add enough water to cover the eggs by about 2 cm (1 inch).  

2. **Heat the water:**  
   - Bring the water to a gentle boil over low-medium heat.  

3. **Cook the eggs:**  
   - For soft-boiled eggs: Simmer for 40–60 minutes.  
   - For medium-boiled eggs: Simmer for 70–90 minutes.  
   - For hard-boiled eggs: Simmer for 30 - 120 minutes.  

4. **Cool the eggs:**  
   - Transfer eggs to a bowl of ice water immediately.  
   - Let them sit for at least 5 minutes to stop cooking and make peeling easier.  

5. **Peel and serve:**  
   - Gently tap the shell and roll the egg to loosen it.  
   - Peel under running water if needed.  

**Tips:**  
- Use older eggs for easier peeling.  
- For runny yolks, use the 4-minute mark.  
- Store unpeeled boiled eggs in the fridge for up to a week.

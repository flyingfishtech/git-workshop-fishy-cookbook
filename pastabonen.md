Paste e Ceci:




    1/4 cup (60 ml) extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for drizzling

    4 medium garlic cloves (20 g), lightly crushed

    1 sprig fresh rosemary

    Kosher salt

    1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes

    2 tablespoons (30 g) tomato paste

    1/2 cup (120 ml) dry white wine

    3 cups (1 pound 2 ounces; 510 g) cooked dry chickpeas or 2 (15-ounce; 425 g) cans low-sodium chickpeas, drained and rinsed, divided (see note)

    4 cups (950 ml) chickpea cooking liquid, homemade chicken or vegetable stock, or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock, divided (see note)

    1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

    8 ounces (225 g) small tubular pasta, such as ditalini

    2 ounces (55 g) finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese, plus extra for serving



Instructions:

    Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Saut√© garlic and rosemary with salt until golden (5 min). Add red pepper flakes (30 sec), then stir in tomato paste and cook until dark red (1 min).

    Add wine, scrape up browned bits, and simmer until slightly reduced (2 min).

    For dried chickpeas: Mash 1 cup chickpeas with 1 cup cooking liquid, then add remaining chickpeas, 3 cups liquid, and black pepper. For canned chickpeas: Blend 1 cup chickpeas with 1 cup stock, then add remaining chickpeas, 3 cups stock, and black pepper.

    Bring to a boil, add pasta, and cook until just shy of al dente, stirring frequently. Adjust consistency with water or stock.

    Remove from heat, stir in cheese, and season with salt. Serve drizzled with olive oil and extra cheese.

Notes:

    Use reserved chickpea cooking liquid if using dried chickpeas.
    Avoid canned chickpea liquid for better texture.
    Best served fresh; refrigerate leftovers for up to 2 days, reheating with added liquid.

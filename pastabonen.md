Paste e Ceci: A Chickpea-tacular Feast for 16
Get ready to chick all the boxes for comfort food with this hearty, garlicky, pasta-packed dish. It’s un-bean-lievably good!

Ingredients:
🫒 1 cup (240 ml) extra-virgin olive oil – because a little drizzle makes everything sizzle
🧄 16 medium garlic cloves (80 g), lightly crushed – that’s a smash hit of flavor!
🌿 4 sprigs fresh rosemary – because you’re rosemarried to great taste
🧂 Kosher salt – season like you mean it!
🌶 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes – just enough heat to make your taste buds pepper in excitement
🍅 ½ cup (120 g) tomato paste – it’s time to concentrate!
🍷 2 cups (480 ml) dry white wine – one for the pot, maybe one for the chef?
🥣 12 cups (2 pounds 4 ounces; 1.02 kg) cooked dry chickpeas OR 8 (15-ounce; 425 g) cans low-sodium chickpeas, drained and rinsed – peas believe me, it’s worth it!
🥄 16 cups (3.8 liters) chickpea cooking liquid, homemade chicken or vegetable stock, or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock – your soup-er star ingredient!
🖤 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper – because a dash of drama is essential
🍝 2 pounds (900 g) small tubular pasta (ditalini, elbows, or any other hole-some shape) – you cannelloni imagine how good this will be!
🧀 8 ounces (225 g) finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese, plus extra for serving – let’s grate this recipe up a notch

Instructions:
Heat oil in a dutch oven over medium heat (or the biggest pot you own—seriously, this is a big dill).

Toss in the garlic, rosemary, and a generous pinch of salt. Sauté until the garlic is golden and fragrant (about 5 minutes). By now, your kitchen should smell un-fir-gettable!

Stir in red pepper flakes and let them spice up your life for about 30 seconds.

Add the tomato paste and cook for a minute until it turns a deeper red—like it’s blushing from all the compliments.

Pour in the wine and scrape up any tasty brown bits from the bottom (those are flavor gold!). Simmer for 2 minutes, because patience is a virtue… and so is wine.

For dried chickpeas: Mash 4 cups of chickpeas with 4 cups of their cooking liquid to get things nice and creamy.
For canned chickpeas: Blend 4 cups of chickpeas with 4 cups of stock (because we’re not blending in, we’re standing out!).

Add the remaining chickpeas, 12 cups of liquid, and black pepper. Bring it all to a rolling boil (cue the drama).

Stir in the pasta and cook until just shy of al dente, stirring frequently (because pasta loves attention). Adjust the consistency with extra water or stock if needed.

Remove from heat and stir in the cheese, because cheese the day! Season with salt to taste.

Serve immediately, drizzled with extra olive oil and topped with more cheese. Get ready for the grate-est bites of your life!

Notes:
🥄 Reserved chickpea cooking liquid is the best stock option—let’s keep it legume-dary!
🚫 Avoid canned chickpea liquid unless you’re a fan of extra starchiness (and who’s got time for that?!).
⏳ Best served fresh—leftovers can be stored for 2 days, but they’ll need a little extra liquid when reheating (because pasta is thirsty).

Enjoy your pasta-tively amazing meal! 🍝✨
